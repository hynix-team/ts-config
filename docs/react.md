## File Properties:

1. **"$schema"**: This property specifies the URL of the JSON schema describing the structure and valid properties of the `tsconfig.json` file. It helps in validating the `tsconfig.json` file against the schema.

2. **"display"**: This property specifies the display configuration for the TypeScript errors and warnings in the editor. In this case, it's set to "React Library", indicating that the configuration is optimized for developing React libraries.

3. **"extends"**: This property allows extending another configuration file (`base.json` in this case), inheriting and overriding its settings. It enables maintaining a base configuration while customizing specific settings for this project.

4. **"compilerOptions"**: This section contains various configuration options for the TypeScript compiler.

    - **"lib"**: Specifies the standard library files to be included in the compilation process. In this case, it includes `ES2015` and `DOM` libraries.
    
    - **"module"**: Specifies the module format for the compiled code. It's set to `"ESNext"`, which allows using the latest ECMAScript features.
    
    - **"target"**: Specifies the ECMAScript target version for the compiled code. It's set to `"ES6"`, indicating that the code will be compiled to ECMAScript 2015 (ES6).
    
    - **"jsx"**: Specifies the JSX compiler option. It's set to `"react-jsx"`, indicating that JSX syntax will be transpiled to React createElement calls.
    
    - **"noEmit"**: Indicates whether the compiler should not emit any output files during the compilation process. This is set to `true`, which means no JavaScript files will be generated.
