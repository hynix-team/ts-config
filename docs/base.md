## File Properties:

1. **"$schema"**: Specifies the URL of the JSON schema describing the structure and valid properties of the `tsconfig.json` file. This is used for validating the `tsconfig.json` file against the schema.

2. **"display"**: Defines how errors and warnings are displayed in the editor. "Default" means the editor will use its default settings to display errors and warnings.

3. **"compilerOptions"**: This section contains various configuration options for the TypeScript compiler.

    - **"composite"**: Indicates whether compilation should be performed in incremental mode, where the compiler maintains additional information to enable efficient compilation across multiple parts of the project.
    
    - **"declaration"**: Indicates whether declaration files (.d.ts) should be generated during compilation.
    
    - **"declarationMap"**: Indicates whether a declaration map file (.map) should be generated for the generated declaration files.
    
    - **"esModuleInterop"**: Allows interoperability between ES6 modules and CommonJS, enabling importing ES6 modules as if they were CommonJS modules.
    
    - **"forceConsistentCasingInFileNames"**: Ensures that file names match exactly the file names provided in the code, including checking for case sensitivity.
    
    - **"allowImportingTsExtensions"**: Allows importing TypeScript files (.ts and .tsx) without specifying the file extension.
    
    - **"noEmit"**: Indicates whether the compiler should not generate any output files during compilation.
    
    - **"inlineSources"**: Indicates whether original sources should be included directly in the output files.
    
    - **"isolatedModules"**: Indicates whether files are treated as independent modules from each other, which can improve compilation efficiency.
    
    - **"module"**: Specifies the module format for the compiled code. In this case, it is set to "ESNext", which allows using the latest ECMAScript features.
    
    - **"moduleResolution"**: Specifies how modules are resolved. "Bundler" indicates that a bundling package (such as Webpack or Rollup) will be used to resolve modules.
    
    - **"noUnusedLocals"**: Indicates whether the compiler should emit a warning for unused local variables.
    
    - **"noUnusedParameters"**: Indicates whether the compiler should emit a warning for unused function parameters.
    
    - **"preserveWatchOutput"**: Indicates whether the output from the previous compilation should be preserved when the compiler is running in watch mode.
    
    - **"skipLibCheck"**: Indicates whether library checking should be skipped. This can speed up the compilation process but may lead to undetected errors in third-party libraries.
    
    - **"strict"**: Enables a set of strict configuration options, which help capture more common errors during compilation.
    
    - **"strictNullChecks"**: Enables strict null checking, where null and undefined values are treated more rigorously.

4. **"exclude"**: List of file or directory patterns to be excluded from compilation. In this case, "node_modules" is excluded, which is common to avoid compiling external library files.
