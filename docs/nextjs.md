## File Properties:

1. **"$schema"**: This property specifies the URL of the JSON schema describing the structure and valid properties of the `tsconfig.json` file. This helps in validating the `tsconfig.json` file against the schema.

2. **"display"**: This property specifies the display configuration for the TypeScript errors and warnings in the editor. In this case, it's set to "Next.js", indicating that the configuration is optimized for developing Next.js applications.

3. **"extends"**: This property allows extending another configuration file (`base.json` in this case), inheriting and overriding its settings. This enables maintaining a base configuration while customizing specific settings for this project.

4. **"compilerOptions"**: This section contains various configuration options for the TypeScript compiler.

    - **"plugins"**: Specifies the plugins to be used during compilation. In this case, a plugin named "next" is being used.
    
    - **"allowJs"**: Indicates whether JavaScript files should be allowed in the project. It's set to `true`.
    
    - **"declaration"**: Indicates whether declaration files (.d.ts) should be generated during compilation. It's set to `false`.
    
    - **"declarationMap"**: Indicates whether a declaration map should be generated for the declaration files. It's set to `false`.
    
    - **"incremental"**: Indicates whether compilation should be performed in incremental mode. It's set to `true`.
    
    - **"jsx"**: Specifies the JSX handling mode. It's set to "preserve", keeping the JSX unchanged.
    
    - **"lib"**: Specifies the standard library files to be included in the compilation process. It includes `dom`, `dom.iterable`, and `esnext` libraries.
    
    - **"module"**: Specifies the module format for the compiled code. It's set to "esnext".
    
    - **"resolveJsonModule"**: Indicates whether JSON module resolution is enabled. It's set to `true`.
    
    - **"strict"**: Activates a set of strict settings that help capture more common errors during compilation.
    
    - **"target"**: Specifies the ECMAScript version for which the code will be compiled. It's set to "es5".

5. **"include"**: List of file or directory patterns to be included in the compilation. In this case, it includes the "src" directory and "next-env.d.ts" file.

6. **"exclude"**: List of file or directory patterns to be excluded from the compilation. In this case, "node_modules" is excluded.
