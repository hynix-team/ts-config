# TS Config

Predefined configurations for TypeScript projects.

## Documentations

- [Base](https://github.com/hynix-team/ts-config/blob/main/docs/base.md)
- [React](https://github.com/hynix-team/ts-config/blob/main/docs/react.md)
- [NextJS](https://github.com/hynix-team/ts-config/blob/main/docs/nextjs.md)

## How to use?

Start by installing the package into your project with the following command:

```bash
npm i @hynix-team/ts-config
```
Now in your `tsconfig.json` file you must expand all the properties of the installed package.
```json
{
  "extends": "@hynix-team/ts-config/base.json"
}
```
âœ… Now you are ready to write your TypeScript codes safely.
